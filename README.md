# Airtable to Firestore

Organizing data in Firestore is a challenging task. So we created a simple library that helps you push data from Airtable to Google Firestore.

## Guide
1. Run `npm install` in the project root.
2. Enter your Airtable API key and Firestore credentials in the .env file.
3. Run `node airtable.js <BASE> <COLLECTION>` in your console, but replace them with the Airtable base name and the Firestore collection name. 
4. That's it! Your data will now be pushed to Firestore.
